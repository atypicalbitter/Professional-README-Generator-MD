## Introduction

My goal with this application was to build a functioning readme generator to be used in the terminal using node.js

## Installation 

N/A

## About

I started off by adding in the DS_Store to the gitignore within the starter code as i am using a Mac. I then added in the sections that would make up a readme and were highlighted within the challenge.

I added the questions into the readme, which the majority were 'input' types as with the readme generator I wanted the user to be able to type as much or as little as they needed to, to describe their project. Except on the License section where they are given a list of 3 popular licenses and the choice of 'other' also. This I paired with the ability for the license badges to be displayed at the top of the readme in alignment with what was asked of us in the challenge. I used a switch case here so that the user could cycle through the options provided which I used the 'list type' option. 

Along with the option to add your email and github link the readme.
